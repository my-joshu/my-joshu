## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **User Authentication**

   - Speaker login and registration
   - Anonymous access for attendees
   - Authentication state management

2. **Presentation Management**

   - Creating new presentations
   - Setting presentation details (title, description, schedule)
   - Uploading presentation slides for content extraction
   - Generating QR codes for audience access

3. **Q&A Session**

   - Real-time question submission by attendees
   - Question display for speakers
   - Marking questions as answered
   - Basic question management

4. **AI-Powered Answer Hints**
   - Integration with Google Gemini API
   - Generating contextual hints based on presentation content
   - Storing and retrieving answer hints

### Technical Infrastructure

1. **Database**

   - Schema design and implementation
   - Relationships between entities
   - Real-time subscriptions

2. **Frontend**

   - Responsive UI for both speakers and attendees
   - Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
   - Basic error handling

3. **Backend**
   - API routes for answer hint generation
   - Authentication middleware
   - Server actions for form handling

## What's Left to Build

### Feature Enhancements

1. **Question Upvoting**

   - Implement upvoting functionality for questions
   - Sort questions by popularity
   - Visual indicators for popular questions

2. **Advanced Answer Hints**

   - Improve prompt engineering for better hints
   - Add more context from presentation content
   - Support for different types of hints (factual, conceptual, etc.)

3. **Presentation Analytics**
   - Track question patterns
   - Analyze audience engagement
   - Generate post-presentation reports

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Mobile Optimization**

   - Further refinement of mobile interfaces
   - Touch-friendly interactions
   - Responsive design improvements

2. **Accessibility**

   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Color contrast improvements

3. **Error Handling**
   - More comprehensive error states
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery options

### Technical Debt

1. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for critical components
   - Integration tests for key flows
   - End-to-end testing

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Query optimization
   - Component rendering optimization
   - Lazy loading and code splitting

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Deployment guides

## Current Status

The project is currently in an early development stage with the following status:

1. **MVP Features**

   - Core functionality is implemented
   - Basic user flows are working
   - Initial AI integration is in place

2. **Development Environment**

   - Local development setup is complete
   - Supabase local instance is configured
   - Database migrations are in place

3. **Deployment**
   - Not yet deployed to production
   - Preparing for initial deployment
   - Environment configuration in progress

## Known Issues

### Functional Issues

1. **Question Upvoting**

   - Upvoting UI is present but not fully implemented
   - Backend support for upvoting is incomplete

2. **Answer Hint Quality**

   - AI-generated hints sometimes lack specificity
   - Context extraction from presentations could be improved
   - Occasional irrelevant suggestions

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Occasional delays in real-time updates
   - Reconnection handling needs improvement

### Technical Issues

1. **Database Queries**

   - Some queries could be optimized for better performance
   - Missing indexes for certain query patterns

2. **Error Handling**

   - Inconsistent error handling across components
   - Some edge cases not properly handled

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Some UI elements not optimized for smaller screens
   - Touch targets could be improved

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**

   - Need to implement additional security measures
   - Review authentication flow for potential vulnerabilities

2. **API Security**

   - Rate limiting not yet implemented
   - API endpoint protection needs review

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Need to implement proper data retention policies
   - Review data handling for compliance with regulations
